This plugin allows you to add a widget to sidebar with quotes from your published posts. The quotes will be shown with link to the rest of the post. Also, it allows you to add some useless knowledge facts.

<?php show_mmdyk (_num, _blank, _credits) ?>

The parametar are:
	_num - number of displayed qutes (default: 1)
